Face Detection Concepts

Face detection locates human faces in visual media such as digital images or video. When a face is detected it has an associated position, size, and orientation; and it can be searched for landmarks such as the eyes and nose.

Here are some of the terms that we use regarding the face detection feature of ML Kit:

  1  Face tracking extends face detection to video sequences. Any face that appears in a video for any length of time can be tracked from frame to frame. This means      a face detected in consecutive video frames can be identified as being the same person. Note that this isn't a form of face recognition; face tracking only     makes inferences based on the position and motion of the faces in a video sequence.

 2  A landmark is a point of interest within a face. The left eye, right eye, and base of the nose are all examples of landmarks. ML Kit provides the ability to       find landmarks on a detected face.

 3   A contour is a set of points that follow the shape of a facial feature. ML Kit provides the ability to find the contours of a face.
    Classification determines whether a certain facial characteristic is present. For example, a face can be classified by whether its eyes are open or closed, or      if the face is smiling or not.
